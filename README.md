# BILL - CYPHER

### 🚀 What is Bill-Cypher?
Bill-Cypher is a blazingly fast, highly functional web app that uses a feature-driven GenAI-compatible distributed ledger AngularJS frontend Bun app and a backend server to decrypt Vigenère cyphers. 

### 🖥️ How does the backend server work?
The backend server uses a RESTful API to interface with the front end, and uses extremely optimized algorithms to deliver a response in record time. It is written primarily in PHP, C# and C.
